# Welcome to the SalesTim API SDKs repo
**ABSTRACT**

The SalesTim API SDK provides easy to use client and server libraries for accessing The SalesTim REST API.  
To learn more about the SalesTim API, see our [API Documentation](https://developers.salestim.com/api) or try it online with our [API Explorer](https://developers.salestim.com/api/explorer).

This repository contains multiple SDKs for various clients and servers, each one of them located in their own folder in the `src` directory.

## A. LANGUAGES AND PLATFORMS

### Supported and Experimental SDKs
As of today, here is the current status for each language / platform:

| Language / Platform | Directory | Description | Status |
|:--------------------|:----------|:------------|:--------|
| **Node & JavaScript** | [./javascript/](./javascript/) | JavaScript module for the SalesTim API service. This library works both on the server with `Node.js` and in the browser environment with `JavaScript`. | ðŸ¥ˆ Beta |
| **PowerShell** | [./powershell/](./powershell/) | PowerShell module for the SalesTim API service. Cmdlets should work in any environment supported by `PowerShell Core`. | ðŸ¥‰ Alpha |
| **Salesforce Apex** | [./apex/](./apex/) | Salesforce sample Force App for the SalesTim API service. Relies on the `sfdx` module. | ðŸ§ª Experimental |
| **AspDotNet Core** | [./aspnetcore/](./aspnetcore/) | `Asp.Net` server sample project. This sample should work in any environment supported by `.NET Core`. | ðŸ§ª Experimental |
| **C# > .NET Core** | [./csharp-netcore/](./csharp-netcore/) | C# client library for the SalesTim API service. This library supports `.NET Core`, `.NET Framework` and `Mono/Xamarin` environments. | ðŸ§ª Experimental |
| **Node + Express** | [./nodejs-express-server/](./nodejs-express-server/) | `Node.js` server sample project with `Express` built-in. This sample should work in any environment supported by `Node.js`. | ðŸ§ª Experimental |

Legend:
- ðŸ¥‡ GA > Generally Available, suitable for production use.
- ðŸ¥ˆ Beta > Selected partners and customers beta testing.
- ðŸ¥‰ Alpha > SalesTim API SDK community internal testing.
- ðŸ§ª Experimental > Investigated as interest in this platform has been demonstrated.

### Technologies
The source code generation process () relies on two different code generators:
- [Autorest](https://github.com/Azure/autorest) the the `PowerShell` client.
- [OpenAPI Generator CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openapitools/openapi-generator-cli) for all other languages and platforme.

**Why two different generators?**  
The `Autorest` powershell generator if far ahead of the competition, especially:
- The generated code has better comments and is more readable.
- It includes scripts and resources to package cmdlets with `NuGet` and publish them to the [PowerShell Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/). 
- It's used in production by Microsoft to generate `Azure` cmdlets... and should therefore be more battle-tested and reliable.

On the other hand, `OpenAPI Generator CLI` is easy to use, broadly used in production, well documented and has a large community.

## B. CONTRIBUTE

### Get the sources and generate SDKs
To generate all SDKs in one operation, launch from the command line:
```shell
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/SalesTim/api-sdk.git
# Download dependencies
npm install
# Generate ALL SDKs
npm run gen-all
```

### Build SDKs individually
You can also generate SDKs individually, by using the following commands.

#### Node & JavaScript  
```shell
# Generates the javascript server and client library
npm run gen-javascript
```

#### PowerShell
```shell
# Generates ps1 scripts
npm run gen-powershell
# Build the module
npm run build-powershell
# Package the module
npm run pack-powershell
```

N.B: Source code generation for `PowerShell` relies on [AutoRest](https://github.com/Azure/autorest), that itself runs on NodeJS, which should make it quite portable. But the build and packaging scripts depends on `PowerShell Core` and `.NET Core`, which may be a more limiting factor.  
To install these dependencies globally, you can use the following scripts:
```shell
# PowerShell Core 6.1+
npm install -g pwsh
# Dotnet Core 2.1+
npm install -g dotnet-sdk-2.1
```

#### Salesforce Apex
```shell
# Generates the sfdx sample project sources
npm run gen-apex
```

#### AspDotNet Core
```shell
# Generates aspnet core sources
npm run gen-aspnetcore
# Build using the dotnet command
npm run build-aspnetcore
```

#### C# > .NET Core
```shell
# Generates the sfdx sample project sources
npm run gen-csharp-netcore
```

#### Node + Express
```shell
# Generates the sfdx sample project sources
npm run gen-nodejs-express-server
```
